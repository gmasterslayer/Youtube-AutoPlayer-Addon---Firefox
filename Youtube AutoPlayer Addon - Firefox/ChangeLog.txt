version 1.0

created a monkeyscript that autoclicks the youtube 'are you still watching' nag

version 1.1

performance update and bug fixes. no longer runs the script on multiple websites.

version 1.2

ported the monkeyscript to a firefox addon with statistics and toolbar integration.

version 1.2.1

Bug fix:
	fixed a bug causing the autoplay counter to continuously count after closing the first popup in
	adfree enviroments and continuous counting in ad enviroments

version 1.3
	Bug Fix - youtube will sometimes reload the page resulting in a paused video. 

version 1.4
	Now checks if the video element has been reloaded. This is done by checking if the script is
	running for the first time and a paused video is detected. This feature will prevent the page from from randomly
	pausing the video outside of the nags and page reloads. 
todo:

DONE - by popular demand this will also be ported to chrome. support is expected to be good as the mozilla api is 
based on the chromium api.

update the chrome port.

refactor the code to utilize browser storage api instead of cookies. Mozilla did not like it without a prompt. will probably
just be cheap and add a prompt in instead of the refactor though. Should the netflix update be included then it will be refactored

Possible updates

include support for other websites with nags such as netflix
